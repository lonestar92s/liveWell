# liveWell


liveWell is a web app that allows the user to search a neighborhood or address and see the average rent price/home cost. The user can then add an address/neighborhood to a watch list and make a pros/cons list to narrow down their favorites. The overall goal of this app is to allow a more efficient way for users to compare homes/neighborhoods combining different criteria.
